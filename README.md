- Using SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost we have trained credit card transaction dataset to classify fraudulent transaction. 
- Issue of class imbalance is dealt with using undersampling and oversampling (SMOTE). 
- PCA, t-SNE are used to visualize the data in 2-D. 
- AUPRC, AUROC, Accuracy metrices are used to evaluate the models
